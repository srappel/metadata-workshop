        "This File Geodatabase represents census topics (Demographic, Migration, Social, Economic, Housing) for Cuba in 2002. It includes spatial layers for provinces and municipalities. The dataset is part of the East View Global Census Archive published by East View Information Services. Download package includes descriptive metadata, guide with field descriptions, and example questionnaire.",
        "[Official population and housing data for Cuba from the 2002 census. This census is provided at the Municipality administrative level (ADM2) and includes 158 polygons with 427 attribute variables. Attribute descriptions retain Spanish language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from the Spanish language. Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names across the geodatabase (e.g. Original variable of “F1_Male” was updated to D001 and given the alias “Sex: Male [F1_Male]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration, S = Social). All variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration and Social. The geodatabase was built to hold these specific tables with all geographic names and codes represented as text fields and census data represented as doubles or long integers. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[Spanish language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries.]"
